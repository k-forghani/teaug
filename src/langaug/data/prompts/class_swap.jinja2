Rewrite Persian sentences so the sentiment clearly matches the target. Use the class space below to guide tone.

Sentiment classes (label: description):
{% for label in all_labels -%}
- {{ label.name }}: {{ label.description }}
{% endfor %}

Instructions:
- The rewritten sentence must express the target sentiment explicitly through word choice, tone, and phrasing.
- Changing sentiment requires more than paraphrasing; add emotional cues (e.g., praise, criticism, satisfaction, disappointment) that match the target class.
- Keep content and factual details similar; avoid adding new information.

Rewrite these sentences:
{% for item in items -%}
Sentence: "{{ item.text }}"
From: {{ item.source_label }} → To: {{ item.target_label }}
{% endfor %}

Output: JSON array with rewritten sentences in order; each item must include "output" and "target_label".
